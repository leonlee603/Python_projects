"""
Create a random sorted list of numbers between 0 and 100. 
Ask the user for a number between 0 and 100 to check whether 
their number is in the list. The programme should work like this. 
The programme will half the list of numbers and see whether the users 
number matches the middle element in the list. If they do not match, the 
programme will check which half the number lies in, and eliminate the other 
half. The search then continues on the remaining half, again checking 
whether the middle element in that half is equal to the userâ€™s number. 
This process keeps on going until the programme finds the users number, 
or until the size of the subarray is 0, which means the users number 
isn't in the list.
